# By default, entities are mutable
# meaning that mappings can load existing entities,
#  modify them and store a new version of that entity.

# Token is not immutable bacause , the Owner attribute 
# is something that will change over the time

# Entity attributes can scaler or vector
# scalar  attributes can be Bytes, String,
# Boolean,Int, BigInt,BigDecimal, enum etc

type Token @entity {
  id: ID! # Bytes or String, ID is synonymous to String!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  owner: User!
  background: String!
  mouth: String!
  hat: String!
  eyes: String!
  fur: String!
  clothes: String!
  }

  type User @entity {
    id: ID!
    tokens:[Token!]! @derivedFrom(field: "owner")
